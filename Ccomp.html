      <h1>Cluster Computing</h1>
      <p>A computer cluster is a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike grid computers, computer clusters have each node set to perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software. <br> The components of a cluster are usually connected to each other through fast local area networks, with each node (computer used as a server) running its own instance of an operating system.</p>
      <br>

      <p>
      Load-balancing clusters are configurations in which cluster-nodes share computational workload to provide better overall performance. For example, a web server cluster may assign different queries to different nodes, so the overall response time will be optimized.
      </p>
      <p>Cluster Can be classified into two categories Open and Close Cluster</p>
      <p>
        Open Cluster: All nodes in Open Cluster are needed IPs, and that are accessible through internet/web, that cause more destruction
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
       Close Cluster: On the other hand Close Cluster are hide behind the gateway node and provide better security.
      </p>
      <h3>Types of cluster computing</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>1. Load-balancing clusters: As the name implies, this system is used to distribute workload across multiple computers. That system distributes the processing load as possible across a cluster of computers. </li>
        <li>2. High availability (HA) clusters: A high availability clusters (HA cluster) are the bunch of computers that can reliably utilise for redundant operations in the event of nodes failure in Cluster computing. </li>
        <li>3. High performance (HP) clusters: This computer networking methodology use supercomputers and Cluster computing to solve advanced computation problems. </li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h3>Advantages of Cluster Computers</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cost efficiency: In a Cluster computing Cost efficiency is the ratio of cost to output, that is the connecting group of the computer as computer cluster much cheaper as compared to mainframe computers. </li>
        <li>Processing speed: The Processing speed of computer cluster is the same as a mainframe computer.</li>
        <li>Expandability: The best benefit of Cluster Computing is that it can be expanded easily by adding the additional desktop workstation to the system. </li>
        <li>High availability of resources: If any node fails in a computer cluster, another node within the cluster continue to provide uninterrupted processing. When a mainframe system fails, the entire system fails.
         </li>
